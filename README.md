## What is DeepResearch 

DeepResearch is the collection of new and prolific algorithms in the field of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**. It contains the tutorial about the papers as well as their codes. The idea is that Artificial Intelligence is not the realm of researchers only. Even a beginner must be able to run a model without going through the whole trouble using complex libraries and get a feel of it.
